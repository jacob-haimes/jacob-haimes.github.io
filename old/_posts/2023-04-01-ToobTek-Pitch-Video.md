In 2021 my senior design team entered CU Boulder's 2021 New Venture Challenge (NVC) as ToobTek. Our product was an airway management training device, and through guidance from many mentors and hours of collaboration, we made it to the final round of the competition, and were awarded 3rd place for our start-up.

We were primarily judged on the pitch video below. I handled both the filming and editing of this pitch video, including background removal and graphic overlays.
