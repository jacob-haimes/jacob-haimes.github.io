One of the courses that I took while obtaining my Masters Degree was Optimal Design. In this course we built image classifiers from the ground up, worked in depth with topology optimization, and gained experience with commercial solvers while solving Sudoku puzzles. 

For each project, I wrote detailed reports discussing the math and implementation behind each challenge, which can be found below. Note that all code used for each report can be found in the appendices.
