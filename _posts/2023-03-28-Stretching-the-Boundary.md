While obtaining my Master's Degree, I collaborated closely with the [MACLab](https://www.matterassembly.org/), a lab located at the University of Colorado's Boulder campus which is led by [Dr. Robert MacCurdy](https://www.colorado.edu/mechanical/robert-maccurdy).

The images below are both visualizations from a paper that I had the privelege of working on, along with Lawrence Smith and Dr. MacCurdy. "Stretching the Boundary: Shell Finite Elements for Pneumatic Soft Actuators," was published as part of the 2022 IEEE 5th International Conference on Soft Robotics.
