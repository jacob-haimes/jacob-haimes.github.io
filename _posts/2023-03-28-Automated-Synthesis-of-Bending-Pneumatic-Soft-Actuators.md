While obtaining my Master's Degree, I collaborated closely with the [MACLab](https://www.matterassembly.org/), a lab located at the University of Colorado's Boulder campus which is led by [Dr. Robert MacCurdy](https://www.colorado.edu/mechanical/robert-maccurdy).

The plot above is from "Automated Synthesis of Bending Pneumatic Soft Actuators," which was a conference paper in the 2022 IEEE 5th International Conference on Soft Robotics that I workd on alongside Lawrence Smith, Travis Hainsworth, and Dr. MacCurdy. The link to the full paper is provided below:
