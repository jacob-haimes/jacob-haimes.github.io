Biologically Inspired Multi-Agent Systems was a course I attended during my final semester of obtaining my Master's Degree. As the name suggests, this course uses examples of biological phenomena to inform design of algorithms.

In HoPE Against HoPE, the report below, I explore optimization through the use of genetic algorithms aided by the framework of the HoPE model. HoPE, researched and created by Papadopoulou *et al.*, is an agent-based model that accurately simulates the behavior of a flock of homing pigeons when they are under attack from a falcon-like predator. For more information, please read the paper below.
